# PokeDex
Searching for pokemon hasn't ever been easier with our PokeDex.

## Description
Our Pokedex is a consolidated website that contains several different generations of Pokemon. On our home page, you can get a random pokemon, and a random joke as well. In our generations page, you can search in our polished search base for any Pokemon that your heart desires. Hop on over to our favorites page, and you can search for and save various Pokemon for easier access later on.
