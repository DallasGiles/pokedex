# PokeDex
Searching for pokemon hasn't ever been easier with our PokeDex.

## Description
Our Pokedex contains several different generations of Pokemon. On our home page, you can get a random pokemon, and a random joke as well. In our search page, you can search in our polished search base for any Pokemon that your heart desires. Hop on over to our favorites page, and you can interact with the favorited pokemon, and either keep them there, clear the whole list, or remove them one at time by unfavoriting.
