# PokeDex
Searching for pokemon hasn't ever been easier with our PokeDex. You can now randomly generate a pokemon to check out how they look, and you may also generate random programming jokes. We also have a generations page where you can see the pokemon sprites for the starter pokemon in the generation you choose. Then you can take a look at the favorites page where you can add a pokemon to the favorites list.

## Description
Welcome to our pokedex! You can search for pokemon and see their stats. You can see the starters for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation. You can add pokemon you like to the favorites list, and you can randomly generate a programming joke.
