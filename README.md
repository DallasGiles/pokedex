# PokeDex
Searching for pokemon hasn't ever been easier with our PokeDex. You can now randomly generate a pokemon to check out how they look, and you may also generate random programming jokes. We also have a generations page where you can see the pokemon sprites for the starter pokemon in the generation you choose. Then you can take a look at the favorites page where you can add a pokemon to the favorites list.
